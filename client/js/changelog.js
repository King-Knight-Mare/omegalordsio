        'Added a crude clock to tell the time.',
        'Added crafting table. It costs 10 wood and ten stone. You can use it to craft all advanced weapons and tools. Crafting table tells you what is and is not craftable. Image created by Ultio. He will receive an admin code in 3-5 buisness days',

        'If you find a glitch, shoot me an email at jwhite022@student.hampton.k12.va.us and please send a screenshot and accurate description. Assuming I\'m not too busy, I will try to fix it within 1.5 hours'
