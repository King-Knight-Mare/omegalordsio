        'Hammers have been added. All tools except swords can damage walls and resources. Hammers do the most. The stone hammer does 25 damage, which is the same as a diamond axe and almost twice that of a diamond pickaxe. Diamond Hammer does 50 dammage to walls. One shot trees, 2 shot wooden walls and stone, 5 shot stone walls, etc.Hammers qualify as melee weapons and as a result deal more damage than axes and pickaxes.',
